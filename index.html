    <h1>hello and welcome</h1>
    
    welcome to a celebration of early-2000's internet girl culture. I've tried to recreate my experience as accurately as possible,
    down to the coding techniques i used. An example: &lt;li&gt; links seemed kind of daunting so I just used &lt;a&gt; and &lt;br&gt;.
    This was years before flex-box but tables were on their way out so there was a lot of absolute positioning using px values. I 
    remember setting up new 'layouts' with a color scheme, two fonts (no webfonts back then - you had to make do with popular
    system fonts), nav link styling, regular link styling, and blockquote styling. I don't remember ever using a
    blockquote but I think I thought it was fancy to have a custom styled blockquote. <br><br>
    
    i was mostly designing for neopets petpages, which were small pages you could create for your pet, but mostly people used them
    to show off 'graphic's and layouts they had made, as a 'webbie' or hub for the neopets guild they had joined, or as blogs.
    As such there were certain limitations imposed by the neopets filter - no scripts, obviously, but also other peculiar
    limitations that to this day I don't see listed anywhere. There was also a character limit, and so if you'd been running a page
    for a while and therefore had lots of content on it, the inclination was to simplify the code as much as possible.<br>
    Petpages themselves were also in short supply, as you were limited to one per pet, and were only allowed four pets. This
    encouraged one-page designs, often using overflow:hidden on the page, and absolute-positioning sections or pages, navigating by
    anchor links (this is what I've done here).
